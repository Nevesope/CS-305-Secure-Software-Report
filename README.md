# CS-305-Secure-Software-Report
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address? What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

  Artemis Financials uses a public web interface for there information and wants to use the most up-to-date security practices to advance there buisness. They are looking to protect there client Global Rain's client data and financial information. When we discovered the software secuirty vulernabilites with our client we identified solutions for each one. It's important to code securly because this can prevent data leaks. With any company involving tech practices security has now become the forefront of importance. It protects the client and there users properly to en sure there privacy is met. 
  
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

  I had a hard time figuring out the proper tools to diagnose the issues and there fixes. But this eventually came with time and became a lot easier. 
  
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

  We increased layers of security by solving the needs of the clients and finding solutions to there vulnerability's. For example, one was a type of software downloaded and the solution was to reduce access within that software. 
  
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  We made sure the code was functional and secure after we ran the code and fixed the vulnerabilitys. Then once fixed we went through again jsut to confirm that everything checks out. 
  
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  I primarily used the java keytool, orcales websites, and clean cloding practices for this project. All three of these could benefit any coding project that I do in the future. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  To future employers I will show and demonstrate my knowledge fo vulernability assesmments and there value. Also the value of security and data protection.
